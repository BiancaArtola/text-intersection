# Word Intersect Script

This script finds the intersecting words between two input strings.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/BiancaArtola/text-intersection.git
```

3. Navigate to the repository directory:

```
cd text-intersection
```

4. Run the script by providing two strings as command-line arguments:

```
python script.py "string1" "string2"
```

Replace "string1" and "string2" with the actual strings you want to compare.

5. The script will output the intersecting words between the two strings.

## Example

For example, running the script with the following command:

```
python script.py "dog cat bird" "bird fish"
```

will output:

{'bird'}

This means that the word "bird" is present in both input strings.
